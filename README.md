# A repo to track COVID-19 vaccine reservations in Germany

## How does it work?
The script asks for ZIP code for the place of inquiry and a timeout time.
Then it checks impfterminradar.de frequently and reports if any reservation is available.
If a reservation is available, the script sends out a notification.
